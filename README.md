## Overview
For this homework it is supposed to be in Java Micro Edition, precisely in CLDC1.1:
https://docs.oracle.com/javame/config/cldc/ref-impl/cldc1.1/jsr139/index.html

The goal is to realize, in this environment, a library (myLib) born in the environment J2SE 1.4.2
https://www2.cs.duke.edu/csed/java/jdk1.4.2/docs/api/index.html

The library contains the classes implementing the interfaces List and Map and, therefore, Set, Collection, Iterator and ListIterator from J2SE.
The **adapter pattern** has to be used for the aforementioned classes to realize the implementation of the interfaces of J2SE by using **only** the features that are available in CLDC1.1.


The software has to be developed by adopting **Test Driven Development (TDD)** and, therefore, define and implement the test suite Junit for all the developed classes and methods.
Documentation is vital to understand what test cases have been covered and what were the design choices. The documentation has to be generated by using the Javadoc syntax.

## In this project

* ```Test suite execution records```: In this folder you can find the results of the execution of all the tests.
  The name of the file is eself-explanatory:
    - ```Test Results - <className>Tester.html``` tests only a specific class
    - ```Test Results - TestSuite<Target>.html``` tests all the classes related to the target interface (either List or Map)
* ```doc```: contains the Javadoc documentation of this project. Open the ```index.html``` file to have a gerarchic view of all the classes implemented. Custom tags have been defined to have a clearer documentation.
* ```myAdapter```: contains the .java files that realize the 2 adapters
* ```myTest```: contains the .java files used for testing the features

## Compiling and Running

The TestRunner class allows, thanks to the functionalities provided by Java Reflections, to run either all the test suites together or only the desidered ones by telling the names of the classes that you want to run.
From the main folder of the project (after compiling and adding both Junit and Hamcrest to the CLASSPATH):
* Java myTest\TestRunner.java: runs all the tests available and shows the results after the tests execution has ended.
* Java myTets\TestRunner.java myTest.suite1 myTest.suite2 <....>: runs all the tests defined by the suites "suite1" and "suite2". There is no maximum number of suites. An exception is thrown if at least one of the given suites does not exist (or the name is not right).
